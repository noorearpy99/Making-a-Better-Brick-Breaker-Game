# Making-a-Better-Brick-Breaker-Game

Amended the program provided (project.py) so the following requirements are met:

• The window size is 800x600 and the window title is “Brick Breaker – Group #?” where “?”
is your group number (1 point).
• The paddle is 100 pixels wide, and the distance between the bottom of the paddle and
the bottom of the window is 40 pixels (1 point).
• The “Press Space to Start” is centered horizontally, and the “You win! You the Breaker of
Bricks” is amended to “You win this round!” and centered horizontally (1 point).
• Four rows of bricks are shown, with the colors of light green (1 hit to remove), white (2
hits), orange (3 hits), and red (4 hits) (2 points).
• The width of a brick is 50 pixels, and the number of bricks across the window is calculated
based on the width of the window (3 points).
• A label is added to the top-right that records a game score, where hitting a brick scores
10 points (3 points).
• If all the bricks are removed and the player still has lives left, another round is played with
an extra layer of bricks (up to three layers), and the game continues (6 points).

Fix any errors that may be generated by the program. A non-working program can receive no
more than 50%. The program must be structured and formatted appropriately, including a call to
main(), an appropriate program header (1 point), and commenting throughout (2 points).
